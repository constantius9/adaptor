# Diploma #

It's a diploma project of me, Michael Pankov, student of 6th course at Bauman Moscow State Technical University.
Contains 'Adaptor' self-tuning computing framework.

## TODO ##

1. `[×]` Migrate to CouchDB cloud hosting. [CloudAnt](https://cloudant.com/) was chosen.
1. `[×]` Prepare system information collection module.
1. `[×]` Make the system search for needed program, not bail out right after not finding it in root of benchmark.
1. `[ ]` Prepare the experimental scenario.
1. `[ ]` Add the CPU name collection to Probe.
1. `[ ]` Perform 10 runs several times, each with different settings: some with one dataset size, some with other; some with one hardware, some with other. It's hard to get different hardware for me so I must think of emulation (i.e. setting of CPU frequency).

## Ideas ##

Logotype of the system should be a raptor, which is placed accurately between 'A' and 'd' of the title. It imposes wordplay and so on and it's cool.
