# TODO #

1. `[x]` Migrate to CouchDB cloud hosting. [CloudAnt](https://cloudant.com/) was chosen.
1. `[ ]` Prepare system information collection module.
1. `[ ]` Perform 10 runs several times, each with different settings: some with one dataset size, some with other; some with one hardware, some with other. It's hard to get different hardware for me so I must think of emulation (i.e. setting of CPU frequency).
